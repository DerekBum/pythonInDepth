The Minotaur, one of the oldest known surviving demons, was sculpted by ████ ██████
as a gift for the then Judge of Hell,
Minos, in an attempt to form some kind of rapport.

Though its creator considered it beautiful, a personalized monument of death and despair,
Minos was terrified of the
grotesque caricature of his past mistakes and cast it into the Garden of Forking Paths,
hoping it would never be seen again.

Now the Minotaur is old and its body failing, falling apart,
running blind through the labyrinth in a desperate attempt
to break out. Its only desire: to see the sky for one last time.
