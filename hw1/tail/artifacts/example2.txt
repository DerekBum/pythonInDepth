During the departure of the angels after the Disappearance of God, many sinners attempted to escape the Violence layer,
braving the labyrinth that lay at its edges, thinking they could find a way out in the absence of Heaven's wardens.

The fools who attempted would realize far too late that angels were not all that kept them from freedom, as the
Garden of Forking Paths is no ordinary labyrinth, but one of malicious intent, overseen with cunning cruelty.

The halls, each similar enough to give no sense of direction, but just different enough to grant no familiarity, would
eventually exhaust each escapee, and as they fell into a deep sleep, their metamorphosis began.

Each sinner was torn apart joint by joint, their broken and shattered limbs shoved into hollow statues, startling them
to life as the flesh and blood of Mannequins.

The gift of death is a rare privilege in Hell, so the sinners who attempted to control their fate now lay dormant in
eternal agony, unable to control even their own bodies, which now continue to carry on the same punishment to other
unfortunate fools.
